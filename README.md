# Learn tight binding

This is not strickly a tutorial to tight binding although I hope it to be. I am a beginner and am going to learn some theories of tight binding. I wish to make some real progress via reading some books, literature, and coding. This repository could be more likely to be my reading notes as a beginner. If you find this helpful, please star it! Commiting it is also appreciated!

Here, I list the books and materials I learn historically, however, you can choose any of them as the start.

Note that English or Chinese is used to take these notes.
